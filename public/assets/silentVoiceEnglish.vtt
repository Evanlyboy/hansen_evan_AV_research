WEBVTT

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.317
Quit job

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.528
Thank you for everything.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:11.529
Get rid of stuff

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.699
That'll get you around 30,000 yen in total.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.951
Bank

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.952
Shoya Ishida

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.036
Empty the account.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:26.168
Here's your money back

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:58.075
Last day

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:32.318
A Silent Voice

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.177
Class 6-2

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.319
Take your seats, class.

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.991
We have a new friend joining us today.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.706
What?

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.040
Lucky you, Ishida.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.667
It's a girl.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:12.752
So?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.670
You think I care?

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.727
Listen up.

00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:32.938
Okay, introduce yourself.

00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:56.754
For Conversations

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.884
Nice to meet you. I'm Shoko Nishimiya.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.353
Through this notebook,
I hope to become good friends with you all.

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:16.774
Please use it when you need to talk to me.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:31.539
I'm deaf.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.713
Holy crap!

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:41.507
Pleased to meet you, Nishimiya.
I'm Miki Kawai.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.174
There. Nice to meet you. Pleased to
meet you, Nishimiya. I'm Miki Kawai.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:43.801
There. Nice to meet you.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:48.389
Hey, can you speak Japanese?

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.016
Watch your mouth, Nao.

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.226
Come again, please.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.853
Uh...

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.606
Oh.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:03.028
Do you have a nickname?

00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:06.031
I give up! I'm tapping out!

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.908
Sh0, huh?

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:10.160
Same as Ishida, then.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.996
Her nickname's Sho.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.122
Nice.

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:15.749
What? Not nice.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.923
Okay, note down the following sections.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:28.345
Pages 20 through 25,
and the practice problems on page 32.

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:30.306
These will be on the upcoming quiz.

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:35.019
Gimme your notebook.

00:06:36.353 --> 00:06:40.316
First up, the fulcrum.
It's the point that supports the lever.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.611
Then there's the effort,
force that's applied at one point.

00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.989
Finally, there's the load
that is raised or lowered.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.618
Levers fall under three classes
based on their locations.

00:07:11.847 --> 00:07:13.057
Nishimiya.

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.435
You, uh, went too early.

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:20.230
I'll tell you when to start, okay?

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.777
Once more, from the top.

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:30.950
Forget about winning the choir competition.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:33.077
We're screwed.

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:36.288
Here's your punishment for being a lame-o.

00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:38.582
Ow, that hurts.

00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:39.667
Ow!

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.168
Y'know...

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.672
I was distracted for half the class again.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.423
I'll copy my notes for you later.

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:48.467
Thanks a bunch.

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:54.974
"I didn't do anything wrong.
So I will never apologize!"

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.893
You call that a reading, Ueno?

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.063
Forget it. Next.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.773
Screw you too, four-eyes.

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:03.941
Nishimiya.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:08.487
Start from here.

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:15.202
"Qid beig sdubborn a ready,"

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:20.249
sai Mom wid an egasberaded loog.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.835
Bud I don inden do abologize.

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.169
All right.

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:25.421
Next, Ishida.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.756
Are you kidding me?

00:08:36.223 --> 00:08:38.851
Take this seriously, Ishida.

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.237
Could you tell me
what you were talking about?

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:15.679
Let's leave.

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:18.348
Bye bye, Nishimiya.

00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:53.717
You know...

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.514
You need to be smarter about things,
or people will start to hate you.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:02.768
What?

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.233
Frens...

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.153
What?

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:15.906
You're gross!

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:28.418
I'm Kita from the Class for the Deaf.

00:10:28.418 --> 00:10:31.213
Have you all heard of sign language?

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:33.924
It's a language where you use your hands.

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.554
You can have entire conversations
with just hand gestures.

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:40.264
Isn't it amazing?

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:42.391
Sign language...
How does this sound?

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.477
In order to talk to Shoko lots more,

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:49.857
would you spend three minutes of homeroom
each morning learning sign language?

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:54.361
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:54.778
Yes?

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:57.990
Isn't writing in her notebook good enough?

00:10:59.032 --> 00:11:03.120
Using sign language would
make things much easier for Shoko.

00:11:04.788 --> 00:11:08.250
And it's much easier for me to write.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:11.670
I'll do it.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.381
I'll learn sign language.

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.217
Teach me how to say
"Miyoko Sahara" in sign language.

00:11:21.054 --> 00:11:22.139
<i>Ta...</i>

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.932
Hada...

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:24.975
Mi ...

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:25.809
go...

00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:26.894
ko...

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:28.854
"Sa."

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:31.732
Keep scoring them brownie points.

00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:35.360
I love him. He's too cool.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.361
Right?

00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:39.656
Oh, he'll be on a TV show next week.
Can't miss it for the world.

00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:42.242
Aren't her clothes lame as hell?

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.453
Don't say that, Nao!

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.123
Via this book, the author...

00:11:48.123 --> 00:11:50.209
Even after the experiment,
the manganese dioxide...

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:59.343
Hirose, take that side.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.970
"Nishimiya..."

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:04.431
What are you doing, Ishida?

00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:05.891
Stop that.

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:07.226
And a star.

00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:09.853
You're going too far, man.

00:12:09.853 --> 00:12:12.439
Really? I think it's just right.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:15.317
Bad, bad boy.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:16.985
Who cares?

00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:17.819
Congrats, Nishimiya! Sahara went off somewhere.
Teach us Nishimiya-ese sometime! Hurray, hurray!

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:19.863
Looking good! Congrats, Nishimiya! Sahara went off
somewhere. Teach us Nishimiya-ese sometime! Hurray, hurray!

00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.782
Congrats, Nishimiya! Sahara went off somewhere.
Teach us Nishimiya-ese sometime! Hurray, hurray!

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:32.709
Yikes, who did this?

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.962
How mean.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:40.425
I'll wipe it for you, okay?

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:41.677
There.

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:43.470
All gone.

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:59.569
Thank you

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:04.449
You're welcome.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:06.201
Let's bounce.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.581
Back in the Jomon Period...

00:13:17.504 --> 00:13:18.922
Come on, Ishida.

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.133
We're in the middle of class.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.926
I'm very sorry!

00:13:24.594 --> 00:13:27.472
Where were we, again ...

00:13:27.472 --> 00:13:30.892
Right, what kind of houses they lived in.

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:31.184
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.

00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:32.978
Made you jump, huh?
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:33.770
They dug holes in the ground and placed pillars in them.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.107
Hey, Nishimiya.

00:13:39.943 --> 00:13:43.238
If you're wearing these, can you actually hear?

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:46.616
Right. I was wondering that, too.

00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:48.035
Show me for a sec.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.331
Ueno.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.832
What is that?

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:54.541
Lemme see.

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:00.839
Ugh, what is this?

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.799
Gross!

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:11.725
Did you say something? I am ripped -
Dumbass! Nishimiya the Rippest

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:26.323
Nishimiya, are you all right?

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.658
What do we do?

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:31.203
Nishimiya!

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.663
You overdid it, man.

00:14:35.665 --> 00:14:38.502
That four-eyes really pisses me <i>off.</i>

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:43.090
What? Move.

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:44.549
You're in the way.

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:48.178
What is she doing?

00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:49.513
Let's go.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:51.515
I'm sorry.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:56.478
Yeah, right! If you've got a problem, say it!

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.401
Lemme go! You're creeping me out!

00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:05.862
Wow, Nishimiya's funny.

00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:07.823
Shoya's all red!

00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:09.282
I'm not!

00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:24.005
Let's go.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.431
Is she for real?

00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:34.349
She's crazy.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.068
Later, Shoya.

00:15:45.068 --> 00:15:46.278
See you tomorrow.

00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:04.379
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:08.592
It's about Shoko Nishimiya, who's absent today.

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:13.763
Actually, her mother called yesterday.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:21.771
In the past five months, eight of Nishimiya's
hearing aids have been lost or broken.

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:25.567
Her mother believes she is being bullied at school.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:36.036
Have any of you spotted any acts of bullying
or harassment toward Nishimiya?

00:16:36.828 --> 00:16:41.708
Hearing aids are apparently very expensive.

00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:51.718
Before you end up causing
any more trouble for your parents...

00:16:51.718 --> 00:16:52.636
Ishida...

00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:57.349
Look, we all know it was you.

00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.518
Stand up already!

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:01.686
Yes, sir!

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:03.897
Ueno.

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.566
What'd you think of it all, sitting next to him?

00:17:06.566 --> 00:17:08.109
Er...

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:13.740
He might've messed with her from time to time.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.158
And Shimada?

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:19.913
Well, I did tell him to stop.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:21.706
But Shoya didn't listen.

00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:23.750
Wait...

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.836
Shimada, you did just as much as me!

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.257
And the girls were badmouthing her all the time!

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:32.717
Right?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.512
Especially Ueno and Kawai.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.473
You're awful...

00:17:39.474 --> 00:17:42.227
I would never do that!

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.937
Why would you say that?

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:46.273
You're so mean, Ishida!

00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.191
He made her cry...

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.669
Huh? Why is this here? For
Conversations - Shoko Nishimiya, Class 6-2

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:08.461
For Conversations -
Shoko Nishimiya, Class 6-2

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.637
What were you talking about? What do we need to bring for class tomorrow? Figure it out yourself. I'm sorry. Compass.
Thank you. We left cause you were taking too long. What did the teacher just say? Dunno. I can't hear. Dumbass. I'm sorry.

00:18:18.888 --> 00:18:20.807
Yes, I understand.

00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:24.060
We're really sorry for everything.

00:18:25.228 --> 00:18:26.938
Yes, of course!

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.024
Goodbye.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.861
Shoya.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.530
Hold it, Shoya!

00:18:36.364 --> 00:18:39.909
Your teacher told me everything, Shoya.

00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:43.955
Wait, why are you soaking wet?

00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:46.875
Shut up. I jumped off a bridge like always.

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:48.418
Hold on!

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.295
Are you causing trouble for others?

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.339
Don't ask me.

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.592
Was it true, what your teacher said?

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.594
Yeah, it's true!

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.015
We're going to see the Nishimiyas.

00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:03.308
Get ready.

00:19:08.855 --> 00:19:10.482
Mizuho Bank

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:13.253
Let's go home, Sh0.

00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:16.214
Be a good boy from tomorrow.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:17.549
Okay?

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:21.511
Huh?

00:20:22.011 --> 00:20:26.141
They were called "aliens,"
and they had a really hard time.

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:52.250
What are you doing?

00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:56.963
Hey, what are you doing to my desk?

00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:04.387
What were you doing, you creep?!

00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:11.686
That look again?

00:21:12.687 --> 00:21:14.981
Drop the goody-two-shoes act!

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:19.444
What? If you got something to say, say it!

00:21:20.361 --> 00:21:23.198
I don't understand that stupid look,

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.074
and it pisses me off!

00:21:25.074 --> 00:21:27.535
Come on, out with it!

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.039
What was that for?

00:21:31.998 --> 00:21:33.041
What's with you?

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:44.886
I'm dryig...

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:45.595
What?

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.058
I'm dryig, ju no!

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.352
What are you saying?!

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:57.816
What the heck?

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.734
I don't get it!

00:22:19.003 --> 00:22:25.635
Get lost, Ishida.
How long are you gonna stick around?

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:31.099
She really pisses me off...

00:22:32.392 --> 00:22:35.061
Nishimiya transferred out.

00:22:36.729 --> 00:22:37.814
That's that.

00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:42.360
Hey, who was on day duty yesterday?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.736
I didn't get the log.

00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:47.907
And who was on flower duty?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.807
Sign Language Class

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:24.819
Hello there, Shoko.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.706
Nishimiya!

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.297
U-Uh...

00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:46.174
Remember me?

00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:47.592
From sixth grade.

00:23:47.884 --> 00:23:49.594
Shoya Ishida.

00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:02.065
Nishimiya?

00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.274
Wait!

00:24:08.112 --> 00:24:09.072
Nishimiya!

00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:12.742
Huh?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.453
Nishimiya!

00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:21.000
Hey.

00:24:25.588 --> 00:24:27.256
Uh...

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:29.926
Oh.

00:24:30.551 --> 00:24:32.762
I came to give this back. For
Conversations - Shoko Nishimiya, Class 6-2

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.808
You forgot this.

00:24:42.605 --> 00:24:45.274
Why I know sign language?

00:24:45.858 --> 00:24:47.068
I learned it.

00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:49.153
Anyway, here.

00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:56.369
Though you might not want to see it.

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:03.042
Hey...

00:25:03.918 --> 00:25:07.005
Me and you ...

00:25:08.589 --> 00:25:12.093
Could we be friends?

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:15.471
What am I saying?

00:25:16.472 --> 00:25:19.934
Wait, she was saying the same thing
back in grade school.

00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:21.477
I finally understand what she meant.

00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:27.442
Don't cry.

00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:30.987
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.123
Could you be friends with me?

00:25:42.957 --> 00:25:44.542
<i>...!</i>

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.420
<i>...!</i>

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.422
Sh0!

00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:50.965
Wake up!

00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:55.344
Breakfast time!

00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:03.186
Wake up, Sh0!

00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:07.023
Morning, Maria.

00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:09.942
Sh0's up!

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.462
I'm off.

00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:30.880
Goodbye, Mommy.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.215
Have a nice day.

00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:34.050
Here you go, Sh0.

00:26:36.302 --> 00:26:38.304
Thanks for the food.

00:26:38.304 --> 00:26:39.847
Eat up.

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.272
What're you grinning for?

00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:51.359
I mean...

00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:54.278
Here's your money back

00:26:54.695 --> 00:26:57.281
You worked hard at your part-time job, huh?

00:26:57.281 --> 00:27:00.201
You even sold off your manga, clothes, and bed.

00:27:01.994 --> 00:27:04.956
But it really made me happy.

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:10.253
By the way, Sho...

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.798
Why'd you want to kill yourself?

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:19.971
W-Well, a lot happened...

00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:22.473
But, uh, I won't...

00:27:22.473 --> 00:27:23.641
I knew it.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.937
So I was right!

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.689
I knew something was off!

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.941
Your room was way too clean!

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:34.068
Your phone was off!

00:27:34.068 --> 00:27:37.029
And what was with that ominous calendar?!

00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:40.408
All the pages were ripped off from April...

00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:44.412
If you don't promise not to kill yourself,
I'll burn this up.

00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:47.248
I'll burn the 1 .7 million yen
you shed blood, sweat, and tears to earn!

00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:52.545
Hey! You listening to me?

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:54.964
Oh...

00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.257
Don't be stupid.

00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:58.384
Right back at you, you stupid son!

00:27:58.384 --> 00:28:01.053
Uh... I'm sorry!

00:28:01.053 --> 00:28:02.471
I'm truly sorry!

00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:03.431
I won't do it!

00:28:03.431 --> 00:28:05.141
Sorry, I won't do it! Seriously!

00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:07.143
What won't you do? Spell it out!

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.770
I won't kill myself!

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.480
I won't try to kill myself!

00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:13.482
You mean it?

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:15.568
I mean it!

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.653
Good.

00:28:17.653 --> 00:28:18.821
It's a promise, okay?

00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:20.990
Hey, Mom!

00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:25.244
Ow!

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.538
W-Water!

00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:41.093
<i>I was going to jump off a tall bridge
and die yesterday.</i>

00:28:43.095 --> 00:28:46.766
<i>Going to see Nishimiya was part of it too.</i>

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.561
<i>It was the biggest test of courage in my life.</i>

00:28:51.395 --> 00:28:52.647
<i>But...</i>

00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:08.871
Friends...

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.003
What have I done?

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:20.258
<i>At our middle school entrance ceremony,
I overheard Shimada say...</i>

00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:24.845
Stay away from a guy named Shoya Ishida.

00:29:25.596 --> 00:29:28.266
He's a bully.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:37.358
<i>I realized that your sins
always come back to bite you,</i>

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:43.990
<i>and that I had to bear that cross
and the punishment that came with it.</i>

00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:45.700
<i>And then...</i>

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.867
Jerk

00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:48.703
<i>I found myself all alone.</i>
Jerk

00:29:49.161 --> 00:29:51.163
Morning.

00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:28.451
All right, then.

00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:31.370
Have this translated by next time.

00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:42.465
Ishida.

00:30:42.465 --> 00:30:42.965
Yes?

00:30:44.508 --> 00:30:45.384
Kawai.

00:30:45.384 --> 00:30:48.220
Have you submitted your math notebook yet?

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.181
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.474
I see.

00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:53.351
Better get on that, then.

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.560
I will, sorry.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.144
Great.

00:30:58.731 --> 00:31:00.149
Wanna go to the courtyard?

00:31:02.401 --> 00:31:06.447
<i>"Ishida's always by himself, huh?</i>

00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:08.824
<i>He's famous for it. Everyone knows."</i>

00:31:09.408 --> 00:31:10.910
Seriously?

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:14.455
<i>"Oh, he's looking this way again.</i>

00:31:14.955 --> 00:31:17.833
<i>Doesn't he get lonely, being all alone all the time?</i>

00:31:17.833 --> 00:31:19.126
<i>Will he spend his whole life like that?</i>

00:31:20.002 --> 00:31:21.379
<i>Why does he even live, then?"</i>

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.135
S-Say...

00:31:28.135 --> 00:31:30.429
I bought this on release day.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.016
Crap. Maybe I should stop being a fan.

00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:35.726
Same.

00:31:41.315 --> 00:31:42.566
Figures.

00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:45.277
It's true!

00:31:45.277 --> 00:31:46.153
Seriously?

00:32:02.128 --> 00:32:04.630
<i>That hair looks familiar.</i>

00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:07.091
<i>Who was he, again?</i>

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.562
<i>You know...</i>

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:22.022
<i>Can I really go see Nishimiya again?</i>

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.443
<i>She said she regularly feeds the carp bread.</i>

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.822
<i>But man, who do I think I am?</i>

00:32:32.199 --> 00:32:34.368
<i>Maybe I could go apologize
for making her cry?</i>

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:38.456
<i>She said she'd be there every Tuesday.</i>

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:40.583
<i>Would it be creepy?</i>

00:32:53.053 --> 00:32:54.847
I'm back.

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:07.109
Sho...

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.945
You gave me a start.

00:33:10.362 --> 00:33:11.572
What is it?

00:33:13.657 --> 00:33:15.743
Sorry about this morning.

00:33:16.243 --> 00:33:20.331
For burning all that money you earned.

00:33:22.124 --> 00:33:28.005
But I wouldn't want the money
you earned in order to die, anyway.

00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:30.758
Sorry.

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.134
I'll earn it again.

00:33:32.134 --> 00:33:34.220
My, thank you.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.430
Take your time.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.057
You must be starving.

00:33:38.057 --> 00:33:38.974
Come, let's eat.

00:33:38.974 --> 00:33:40.392
Starving!

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:51.737
<i>Tuesday...</i>

00:33:56.867 --> 00:34:00.037
Hey, could you let me borrow your bike?

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:00.704
<i>Who, me?</i>

00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:03.082
Huh? For what?

00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:04.124
<i>Oh, it's that guy.</i>

00:34:04.124 --> 00:34:05.918
I forgot something.

00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:07.336
I want to go get it.

00:34:07.336 --> 00:34:09.755
What? What the heck?

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.675
Take your own bike.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.553
I'm asking you because I don't have one!

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.138
Stop it.

00:34:18.138 --> 00:34:19.306
Let go, dude.

00:34:19.306 --> 00:34:20.432
Hey, knock it off.

00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:22.059
Somebody help!

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.102
Dude...

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.772
Anybody!

00:34:26.772 --> 00:34:27.064
Hey!

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:27.523
Crap!
Hey!

00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:29.066
Help me!

00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:30.693
Keep it down!

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.406
Let go!

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.116
Uh...

00:34:38.742 --> 00:34:40.286
You can take mine.

00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:42.746
For real?

00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:43.956
You're a god.

00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:49.378
<i>I didn't get it back.</i>

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.424
<i>And it just had to happen on a Tuesday.</i>

00:34:54.008 --> 00:34:57.136
<i>Is it a sign that I shouldn't go see her?</i>

00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:03.100

is telling me not to go.</i>

Fluffy New Bread Discount

00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:16.280
I need a really neat, natural-sounding excuse.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.996
Discount coupon for some fluffy new bread?

00:35:25.497 --> 00:35:26.457
This is it!

00:35:27.124 --> 00:35:29.043
I-Is Nishimiya here?

00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:30.753
She's not here.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.713
Uh, she's right there.

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:34.048
She's not.

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.676
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:39.762
Excuse me for asking,

00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:42.598
but are you really friends with her?

00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:44.933
Goodbye.

00:35:51.857 --> 00:35:53.233
Nothing.

00:35:54.693 --> 00:35:56.945
There was just a rat out there.

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.989
A super creepy one.

00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:04.662
Don't worry. It's never coming back.

00:36:12.252 --> 00:36:13.587
Friends...

00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:28.435
What?

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:30.437
Why?

00:36:32.147 --> 00:36:33.941
There he is.

00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:35.234
Ishida!

00:36:35.818 --> 00:36:38.028
Look at this!

00:36:38.028 --> 00:36:40.614
This is your bike, right?

00:36:42.282 --> 00:36:44.076
Good timing!

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:48.205
I'm glad it had your address on it.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.834
Where did you find it?

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.669
Dumped in a paddy field.

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:56.338
Man, I had to look everywhere.

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:59.925
I'm glad I got it back for you, though.

00:37:07.182 --> 00:37:08.684
What's wrong, Ishida?

00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:10.769
Oh, uh...

00:37:12.062 --> 00:37:13.480
What's your name?

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:15.858
I'm Nagatsuka.

00:37:16.483 --> 00:37:18.652
I sit behind you, you know.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.115
Oh, right. This is good bread.

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.033
Want some, Nagatsuka?

00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:27.244
Ishida!

00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:28.787
Ishida!

00:37:30.456 --> 00:37:31.623
Morning.

00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.126
Morning.

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:37.463
Ishida.

00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:40.215
Let's go hang out after school today.

00:37:40.507 --> 00:37:42.718
To mark the start of our friendship.

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:45.721
Over here, Ishida.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.412
Is something wrong, Yasho?

00:38:12.247 --> 00:38:13.582
N-Nothing.

00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:15.000
Wait, Yasho?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.960
Makes us seem like big friends, right?

00:38:19.963 --> 00:38:22.007
And? Is something on your mind?

00:38:22.382 --> 00:38:24.051
Feel free to tell me.

00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:25.677
We're best friends.

00:38:30.057 --> 00:38:32.059
Say, Nagatsuka...

00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:35.604
What are friends, anyway?

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:43.237
You know, does one need to fulfill
any requirements to be a friend?

00:38:44.446 --> 00:38:46.156
Look, Yasho.

00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:50.786
Hold out your hand.

00:39:04.466 --> 00:39:06.760
And that is what friends are.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.303
You see, Ishida...

00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:14.268
I think friendship defies logic or words.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.521
And requirements can kiss my ass.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.273
How stupid.

00:39:21.984 --> 00:39:22.776
She's not here.

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:24.528
Uh, she's right there.

00:39:24.778 --> 00:39:25.696
She's not.

00:39:26.238 --> 00:39:28.740
Uh, who are?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.535
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.

00:39:32.661 --> 00:39:35.038
Well, that sucks.

00:39:35.038 --> 00:39:37.791
For the bread, not me.

00:39:38.208 --> 00:39:40.586
So, huh...

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.713
Nishimiya likes younger boys?

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.631
Wow, that's kinda unexpected.

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:47.759
Here, take the bread, at least.

00:39:47.759 --> 00:39:48.594
It's good bread.

00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:49.052
Look.

00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:53.682
If you're here just to make yourself
feel better, please leave.

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.146
Are we done here?

00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:00.606
Goodbye.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.442
Hey, laddy!

00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:06.570
My bud says he wants to see Nishimiya!

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.404
Nagatsuka?

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.781
Quit being an ass and bring her out!

00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:12.034
What are you doing here?

00:40:12.951 --> 00:40:13.994
I followed you.

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:15.746
That's what best friends do, right?

00:40:16.663 --> 00:40:19.458
I guess turds of a feather drop together.

00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:21.084
Shithead.

00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:24.254
Excuse me? What's your problem?

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.258
I dare you to say that again!
Hey, Nagatsuka...

00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:30.218
Shithead!

00:40:30.218 --> 00:40:31.303
Hey, look.

00:40:31.303 --> 00:40:32.846
What's going on?

00:40:32.846 --> 00:40:34.139
Isn't that Yuzuru?

00:40:34.139 --> 00:40:34.973
Oh, no.

00:40:34.973 --> 00:40:36.391
They're fighting.

00:40:36.391 --> 00:40:37.017
Nagatsuka...

00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:37.809
Nagatsuka!

00:40:38.685 --> 00:40:40.187
Stop it.
Take it back!

00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:41.438
Come on, Nagatsuka.

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:42.898
Forget it. Let's go.

00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:44.066
Nagatsuka...

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:45.400
Why, you...

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.153
My, if it isn't the boy from the other day.

00:40:48.528 --> 00:40:51.198
No, you're wrong...

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.658
Sorry, Nagatsuka!

00:40:52.658 --> 00:40:55.118
Ow!

00:40:58.497 --> 00:40:59.790
Crap!

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:02.167
Damn it, they met.

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:03.752
I'm happy for you, Ishida.

00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:07.339
Hey, laddy.

00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:09.049
Are you peeping at them?

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.051
Let me see!

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:13.595
Hmm?

00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:16.598
Ishida's waving his hands around.

00:41:16.598 --> 00:41:18.100
Probably using sign language.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.184
What?

00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:21.186
Wow.

00:41:21.186 --> 00:41:23.397
I never knew he had that skill.

00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:26.108
Wait, you know sign language?

00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:26.942
Interpret for me!

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.947
"Who was that shithead?"

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.242
"Don't know him at all."

00:41:35.784 --> 00:41:37.661
"What a creep!"

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.913
And do it right!

00:41:39.913 --> 00:41:41.707
Let go.

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.169
Don't fall, laddy.

00:41:46.712 --> 00:41:51.925
"I felt like I shouldn't come see you.

00:41:52.718 --> 00:41:59.599
I've spent the past two weeks
thinking about what friendship means.

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:09.026
I was searching for a reason to meet you."

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:12.988
Ishida...

00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:15.490
"I'm so glad.

00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:20.829
I was thinking the same thing.

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:22.873
Funny, right?"

00:42:24.791 --> 00:42:27.419
Er...

00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:28.712
Here, Nishimiya.

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.380
Bread. For the carp.

00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:38.889
Is feeding them fun?

00:42:40.098 --> 00:42:41.725
Oh, okay.

00:42:50.108 --> 00:42:51.151
For Conversations -
Shoko Nishimiya, Class 6-2

00:43:01.536 --> 00:43:05.290
Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.761
Wait, Nishimiya!

00:43:21.848 --> 00:43:22.557
Jumped in...

00:43:22.557 --> 00:43:23.100
What's wrong?

00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:24.851
Did something happen to Ishida?!

00:43:24.851 --> 00:43:26.520
Hey, laddy!

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.648
Ishida jumped into the river?!

00:43:29.856 --> 00:43:30.857
Why?!

00:43:30.857 --> 00:43:31.900
Ow!

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.193
What was that for?

00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:47.749
Ew, what is this?

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:50.252
Nishimiya.

00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.095
Nishimiya!

00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:04.891
Sorry I dropped it.

00:44:31.793 --> 00:44:34.171
Shoko's such a fool.

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:45.599
Anyone got the balls to beat me? #tochihigh #hot guy #cute cats
#soothingpics #beautiful scenery #blossomviewingspots *oodrecs #idolpics

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:50.812
Serves you right, jerk.

00:44:50.812 --> 00:44:52.189
Did you see this?

00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:54.983
What the heck? Isn't that Ishida?

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:57.444
"See you again"...

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:00.488
Is she really okay with it?

00:45:04.075 --> 00:45:04.910
Hey...

00:45:05.952 --> 00:45:07.704
This is you, right?

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.080
This guy.

00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:11.833
Wh-What is this?

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:20.592
Ishida, come to the staff room.

00:45:21.551 --> 00:45:22.594
Suspension Notice The following student has failed to follow the school's code of
conduct in public and has thus been suspended for a week. Class 3-B - Shoya Ishida

00:45:22.594 --> 00:45:23.762
I recently jumped off of Suimon Bridge and into the river despite it being banned Suspension Notice The following
student has failed to follow the school's code of conduct in public and has thus been suspended for a week.

00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:29.142
I recently jumped off of Suimon Bridge
and into the river despite it being banned

00:45:29.142 --> 00:45:31.394
and then uploaded a photo of it to the internet...

00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:33.188
Shoya!
and then uploaded a photo of it to the internet...

00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:38.526
Sorry, but could you go pick up Maria?

00:45:38.526 --> 00:45:41.238
Uh, I'm not allowed to go out
while I'm suspended.

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.365
Come on, you can go for a bit.

00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:44.449
Thanks.

00:45:44.449 --> 00:45:45.033
Wait

00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:46.618
Hey...

00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:05.887
Time to go home, Maria.

00:46:05.887 --> 00:46:07.097
Sh0!

00:46:07.597 --> 00:46:09.599
Someone's inside!

00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:16.481
Hey...

00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:18.400
Hey!

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.526
You okay?

00:46:22.028 --> 00:46:24.698
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?

00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:26.366
You'll catch a cold.

00:46:27.409 --> 00:46:30.412
Oh, it's the rat.

00:46:32.205 --> 00:46:34.749
What are you doing here?

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:38.545
Where are your shoes?

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.300
Aren't you mad?

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:44.718
About what?

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.557
I was the one who tweeted that pic of you.

00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:52.183
Oh, that was you?

00:46:54.602 --> 00:46:57.856
Boy, am I ever glad it was you.

00:46:58.398 --> 00:47:00.150
What the heck?

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.486
I mean, I can kinda guess why you did it.

00:47:05.447 --> 00:47:06.865
Yell at me, dude.

00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.742
Nah, I can't.

00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:11.161
I had it coming.

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.246
Sh0!

00:47:13.246 --> 00:47:14.581
I'm hungry!

00:47:15.707 --> 00:47:17.167
Coming.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.169
I'll be going, then.

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.879
You should go home soon too.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.007
You have a daughter?

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:25.008
Ow!

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.885
She's my sister's!

00:47:37.771 --> 00:47:38.480
Hey!

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:42.901
Here, Yuzuru.

00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:45.695
Eat up.

00:47:45.695 --> 00:47:46.654
Where's Sis?

00:47:47.238 --> 00:47:48.740
Said she'd be late tonight.

00:47:50.533 --> 00:47:52.327
Is it too hot, Maria?

00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:53.661
It's good!

00:47:53.661 --> 00:47:54.329
Great.

00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:56.331
Aren't you eating, Yuzuru?

00:47:57.582 --> 00:47:59.292
Oh, Yuzuru.

00:47:59.626 --> 00:48:00.835
Say "aah"!

00:48:00.835 --> 00:48:01.669
Go ahead.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.409
Damn it...

00:48:56.057 --> 00:48:57.350
What are you doing?

00:48:58.351 --> 00:48:59.894
That scared me. You suddenly vanished.

00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:03.064
Here, umbrella.

00:49:04.566 --> 00:49:06.860
Just take it.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.861
Seriously.

00:49:09.737 --> 00:49:10.405
Thanks.

00:49:11.489 --> 00:49:12.031
Oh, you...

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.159
Knew it.

00:49:16.744 --> 00:49:17.454
Wanna wear these?

00:49:18.246 --> 00:49:21.249
They're mine, but I don't wear them anymore.

00:49:21.249 --> 00:49:22.167
You can have them.

00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:27.755
Why'd you run away from home?

00:49:29.632 --> 00:49:32.177
I had a fight with Shoko.

00:49:32.177 --> 00:49:33.636
Huh ...

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:39.142
So, like, relationship problems and all that?

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.980
I used her shampoo without asking her.

00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:47.775
She told me go away.

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:52.155
Wait, you two live together?

00:49:55.533 --> 00:49:57.827
Hold the umbrella over yourself.

00:49:57.827 --> 00:49:59.120
We only have the one, right?

00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:03.374
Well, I should've brought two.

00:50:03.917 --> 00:50:07.337
And I can't let you catch a cold,
for Nishimiya's sake.

00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:11.132
Man ...

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.636
What is your deal, Mr. Holier-Than-Thou?

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.681
Trying to make yourself feel better
by helping a stray?

00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:20.308
I know you made fun...

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:25.063
You made fun of her
because she can't hear, right?

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.525
And now you've learned sign language?

00:50:28.983 --> 00:50:29.817
What the heck?

00:50:29.817 --> 00:50:32.237
Think you're a better person now?

00:50:32.695 --> 00:50:34.447
You're disgusting.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.452
Oh.

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.206
Of course Nishimiya's told you.

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:46.709
Yeah, that's right.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:49.295
I'm a terrible human being.

00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:52.507
I have no right to live.

00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:59.389
But at the very least, I don't want to make Nishimiya cry any more.

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:04.018
Oh, I won't try to get between the two of you.

00:51:04.018 --> 00:51:05.061
That won't happen.

00:51:06.938 --> 00:51:10.942
But this also concerns me...

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.084
This is far enough.

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:28.626
Okay.

00:51:31.462 --> 00:51:32.422
Oh, right.

00:51:33.506 --> 00:51:37.051
I'm terribly sorry to burst your bubble,

00:51:37.385 --> 00:51:38.761
but I'm Shoko's...

00:51:40.179 --> 00:51:41.222
Now you know.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.273
Little sister?!

00:51:50.815 --> 00:51:51.858
Later.

00:52:00.992 --> 00:52:02.869
Oh, you're Nishimiya's mother...

00:52:07.582 --> 00:52:08.458
Let's go.

00:52:10.376 --> 00:52:12.754
Hey, you're hurting me.

00:52:14.422 --> 00:52:15.840
I'm sorry.

00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.138
I'm back.

00:52:22.388 --> 00:52:23.431
Yuduru!

00:52:24.432 --> 00:52:25.141
Sis?

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.018
Sowwy! Sowwy!

00:52:27.393 --> 00:52:29.062
I'm sorry too.

00:52:29.854 --> 00:52:33.483
I want some of Grandma's per ill a juice.

00:52:34.192 --> 00:52:37.987
Yuzuru, you should stay away from that boy.

00:52:37.987 --> 00:52:39.364
Tell Shoko too.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.328
We'll decide that for ourselves,

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.454
both Sis and me.

00:52:48.998 --> 00:52:50.333
Hey, laddy.

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.293
How are you doing?

00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:53.628
What brings you here today?

00:52:53.878 --> 00:52:55.963
I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed.

00:52:55.963 --> 00:52:56.964
Wow, laddy.

00:52:57.298 --> 00:52:59.342
You're pretty responsible.

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.886
Nagatsuka, that's not a "laddy."

00:53:02.845 --> 00:53:04.347
She's Nishimiya's little sister.

00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:08.142
I knew that all along.

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:16.150
Thanks for being friends with my Yasho.

00:53:16.859 --> 00:53:20.613
This is my friend Nagatsuka.

00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:26.369
You know,

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.705
I-I got a cellphone.

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:32.500
You have one too, right?

00:53:34.127 --> 00:53:37.505
D-Do you text your friends and stuff?

00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:39.382
From your high school?

00:53:40.341 --> 00:53:41.676
Wow, nice.

00:53:41.676 --> 00:53:44.846
Is there anyone else you'd like to text?

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:47.807
Anyone whose number you'd like to know?

00:53:48.808 --> 00:53:51.519
I see. I could tell you...

00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:52.854
What?

00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:56.482
Sa... ha... ra?

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.905
Sahara, from grade school?

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:10.747
Yasho, Yasho.

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.290
So?

00:54:12.707 --> 00:54:15.168
Will you go see this Sahara?

00:54:15.918 --> 00:54:19.172
Oh, come on. It's not like that.

00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:22.717
I think you're really responsible, though.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.052
Kawai ...?

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:27.430
Yasho?

00:54:27.722 --> 00:54:29.140
But Mashiba...

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:29.932
Kawai.

00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:32.268
What is it?

00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:35.354
I'd like to ask you something.

00:54:36.189 --> 00:54:41.402
Remember Sahara from grade school?
Do you know how to contact her?

00:54:41.819 --> 00:54:43.613
Sahara?

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:45.573
Sorry, I have no idea.

00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:48.284
But I do know which school she goes to.

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.077
Nao goes there.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.955
"Taiyo Girls' Academy."

00:54:54.123 --> 00:54:55.875
Crap. I'm running low on cash.

00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:58.628
Ishida, take this.

00:54:58.961 --> 00:55:01.839
What the heck? I don't need that much.

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:04.008
Don't worry about it, Yasho.

00:55:04.008 --> 00:55:07.303
You'll need to pay for travel,
food, and a love hotel.

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:09.555
You'd feel a lot better if you had this much.

00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:10.223
Huh?

00:55:10.223 --> 00:55:11.432
Hey!

00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:13.559
I brought her.

00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:20.441
Sis was pissed <i>off</i> you were leaving her out
even though she was the one who asked.

00:55:20.441 --> 00:55:23.027
Sorry, but take her with you, Ishida.

00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:50.388
Are you tired? Yuzuru gave me
your number. Thanks for doing this.

00:55:52.139 --> 00:56:00.231
I was really happy
when I heard you found Sahara!

00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:05.194
Yuzuru has told me lots about you.

00:56:05.194 --> 00:56:07.196
Thanks again for today!

00:56:22.461 --> 00:56:27.383
Let's see... We walk from here...

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:30.970
Sh0!

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.306
S-Sorry.

00:56:33.306 --> 00:56:34.515
Sh0!

00:56:35.766 --> 00:56:38.769
It's me, Sahara!

00:56:38.769 --> 00:56:40.062
Remember me?

00:56:42.064 --> 00:56:42.940
Hey.

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.192
Huh? Ishida?

00:56:48.112 --> 00:56:50.865
Long time no see, huh?

00:56:55.036 --> 00:56:58.623
I've kept studying sign language.

00:56:58.998 --> 00:57:00.583
Wait, is that right?

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.253
I left all of a sudden...

00:57:06.839 --> 00:57:08.132
I'm really sorry.

00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:12.386
I've been worried about you ever since.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.723
I'm really glad to see you again.

00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:17.266
What a pleasant surprise.

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:25.733
Really?

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:28.861
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:32.949
Which high school do you go to?

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:36.494
Huh ...

00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:38.788
By the way, your chest has gotten bigger.

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:39.830
What's your cup size?

00:57:40.122 --> 00:57:41.165
Let me check!

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:47.964
What's wrong?

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:50.716
I just need to visit the restroom.

00:57:50.716 --> 00:57:52.593
Okay, got it.

00:57:56.138 --> 00:57:58.265
We're giving out discount coupons!

00:57:58.265 --> 00:57:59.392

00:58:23.624 --> 00:58:25.334
"Meow Meow Club"?

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:37.096
Sahara here! Wow, Ishida. You learned sign language?
Also, thanks for helping us get back in touch!

00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:41.100
Sahara's amazing.

00:58:41.892 --> 00:58:42.518
I couldn't do the things she does.

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:43.310
Save video
I couldn't do the things she does.

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:43.894
Save video

00:58:45.813 --> 00:58:48.649
Should I keep going and have
Ueno meet Nishimiya too?

00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:52.069
What? Not happening.

00:58:53.988 --> 00:58:55.865
Yeah, I agree.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:01.537

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:02.121
All right.
Meow Meow Club

00:59:02.747 --> 00:59:04.665
Shall we go in, Nagatsuka?

00:59:04.665 --> 00:59:06.751
Onward to Meow Meow Club!

00:59:07.376 --> 00:59:08.169
Welcome

00:59:08.169 --> 00:59:09.462
Welcome!

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.589
How long would you like to stay?

00:59:11.964 --> 00:59:13.382
0-one hour, please.

00:59:14.633 --> 00:59:16.594
W-W-We have a discount coupon.
Seriously?

00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:19.055
Understood. Thank you very much.

00:59:19.305 --> 00:59:21.557
Crap. He really came.

00:59:23.184 --> 00:59:24.935
Well, you know...

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.398
What exactly were you hoping for?

00:59:29.398 --> 00:59:31.150
A-And what about you?

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:33.486
Don't be stupid.

00:59:33.486 --> 00:59:37.114
I'm only here to meet your friend.
No dirty thoughts whatsoever.

00:59:37.114 --> 00:59:39.325
Right. Your friend...

00:59:39.658 --> 00:59:40.659
Is she here?

00:59:41.327 --> 00:59:43.788
We're not exactly friends...

00:59:44.246 --> 00:59:44.789
Elaborate.

00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:47.958
A lot happened in sixth grade.

00:59:48.375 --> 00:59:50.419
Things are pretty awkward right now.

00:59:53.547 --> 00:59:54.548
I don't see her around.

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.346
Shall we leave?

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:06.602
Hearing Test Room

01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:16.320
Bug!

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.823
Oh, you're here?

01:00:19.448 --> 01:00:21.117
I came to play with Maria.

01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:25.162
Oh, do you think Nishimiya would like this?

01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:28.791
Cat!

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:32.169
I'm coming in, Sis!

01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:48.978
Sis?

01:00:52.731 --> 01:00:54.275
Gift for you. I'll leave it here.

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:04.702
U ...

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.079
Ueno?

01:01:07.079 --> 01:01:08.247
Go, go!

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:10.666
Wait, what?

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:11.750
Long time no see.

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:13.419
Oh, yeah.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:14.461
Long time no see.

01:01:20.092 --> 01:01:20.593
Huh?

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.261
Isn't that Nishimiya?

01:01:23.387 --> 01:01:25.472
Still alone, I see.

01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:27.516
The poor thing.

01:01:28.893 --> 01:01:31.437
Seriously, Ishida. It's been ages.

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.230
Let's hang out sometime.

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.149
What? I'll pass.

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:37.776
You hate me, don't you?

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:40.613
Not really.

01:01:42.114 --> 01:01:48.287
I've always felt I should've reached out to you.

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:51.081
Sorry about grade school.

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:56.003
Oh, Ueno. Get off.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:04.720
Isn't that a pouch from my workplace?

01:02:05.137 --> 01:02:07.556
Why does she have it? Scary.

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.099
I gave it to her.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.769
Oh, really?

01:02:16.565 --> 01:02:17.816
Later.

01:02:17.816 --> 01:02:19.026
Gotcha.

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:24.156
Ueno?

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.201
Long time no see, Nishimiya!

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:28.619
How have you been?

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:29.620
H-Hey!

01:02:30.162 --> 01:02:31.538
Huh? You're only wearing one?

01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:34.083
What are you doing, Ueno?

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:38.754
We're gonna have fun throwing it around.
Just like old times.

01:02:45.302 --> 01:02:46.929
Sorry, Nishimiya.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.057
No way.

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:51.725
You're kidding me, Ishida.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:54.061
Hang on a sec.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.730
Are you two going out?

01:02:57.189 --> 01:02:58.482
Of course not.

01:02:59.316 --> 01:03:00.693
We're friends.

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:03.988
Friends? That's hilarious!

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:06.115
Friends with the girl you bullied?

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.116
How? Why?

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:10.077
I can't. This is too funny.

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.706
Is it out of guilt or something?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.125
Nah.

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:20.963
You've gotten really lame, Ishida.

01:03:23.882 --> 01:03:27.720
Well, have fun playing friends.

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.729
What we were talking about?

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:38.439
Nothing, really.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:42.192
I'll get going, then.

01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:44.069
See you.

01:04:05.966 --> 01:04:07.301
Yuduru.

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:08.761
Yeah?

01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:10.721
Id monig.

01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:13.182
I'm up. Too surprised to sleep.

01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:14.808
Ead breag !

01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:16.852
Wait, wait. Before that...

01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:18.103
What's up?

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:21.231
Sis...

01:04:22.566 --> 01:04:24.610
You have your hair in a ponytail today.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.694
Why...?

01:04:27.988 --> 01:04:29.198
What a weird face.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.828
Ishida needs to see this.

01:04:36.997 --> 01:04:39.291
Massive outbreak of carp today. Not certain
how many people will come feed them. Be there.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:51.887
Nishimi!

01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:53.847
She's sporting a ponytail?

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:11.573
Ishida, were are you goig?

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.326
Where I'm going?

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:16.912
To the baker's.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.499
Yuzuru asked me to buy some bread for the carp.

01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:24.670
We have enough. Yuduru jud waned do eat.

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:25.337
Hey, Nishimiya.

01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:26.422
You don' have do buy!
Hey, Nishimiya.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.256
You don' have do buy

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.466
Wait. Use sign language.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.263
Do I dalk weerd?

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.013
Kinda.

01:05:37.641 --> 01:05:38.809
Sorry!

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.814
It's fine, really.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:47.234
I-I need to go buy the bread.

01:05:48.485 --> 01:05:49.695
See you.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:56.952
Nishimiya?

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:07.754
For me?

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:09.214
Thank you.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.385
Can I open it?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.139
What the heck are these?

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:22.436
Thanks.

01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:28.066
...moo.

01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:30.360
What?

01:06:31.028 --> 01:06:31.612
These?

01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:36.074
...moo.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.587
I Iub moo!

01:06:58.055 --> 01:06:58.931
Love the moon?

01:07:00.224 --> 01:07:01.058
Yeah.

01:07:02.392 --> 01:07:03.435
It is very pretty today.

01:07:09.733 --> 01:07:10.901
N-Nishimiya?

01:07:14.863 --> 01:07:17.824
Yoohoo! Are you free now? Let's go watch
a movie! From your big friend Nagatsuka

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.411
Say, Nagatsuka.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.413
Do these look like the moon to you?

01:07:23.872 --> 01:07:26.875
The moon? Not really, no.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:29.795
Can

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.880
Doesn't seem like they're candy.

01:07:32.422 --> 01:07:34.800
Nishimiya gave them to me earlier.

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.094
Seriously, what the heck are these?

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.227
Something happen?

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.439
I told Ishida I love him.

01:07:49.439 --> 01:07:50.732
For real?!

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.070
But it didn't get through to him.

01:08:03.036 --> 01:08:05.289
Wow, you changed your hairstyle.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.623
Why'd you change it?

01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:08.125
Did something happen?

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.294
You look great!

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:15.048
Cut it out, guys.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:17.843
I was just running short on time.

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:20.721
Really? But it looks nice.

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.556
Hey, Kawai.

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.766
Why'd you change your hairstyle?

01:08:25.058 --> 01:08:27.644
Why, you ask?

01:08:27.644 --> 01:08:30.230
No special reason, really.

01:08:31.565 --> 01:08:34.443
That's how it goes with girls.

01:08:34.818 --> 01:08:35.652
Oh.

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:38.238
What?

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:43.869
The other day, Mashiba said
he'd like to be friends with you.

01:08:52.544 --> 01:08:54.546
Why are you here?

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.215
Nice to meet you. I'm Sahara.

01:08:57.215 --> 01:08:58.925
Hello. I'm Mashiba.

01:08:58.925 --> 01:08:59.551
Stop that!

01:08:59.843 --> 01:09:01.470
Don't go over my head!

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:04.014
Long time no see, Miyo!

01:09:04.014 --> 01:09:06.058
Hey, where's Nishimiya today?

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:07.768
She went home, saying her tummy hurt.

01:09:09.102 --> 01:09:11.605
Is she avoiding me?

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:12.689
Why?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:18.153
She was trying her best to tell me something
the other day, and I couldn't get it.

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:20.030
What did she say?

01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:21.615
That she loves the moon.

01:09:22.532 --> 01:09:25.994
They're such simple words,
but I couldn't understand them.

01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:28.789
Oh, that would've pissed her off.

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:32.834
Well, if you're worried she's avoiding you,
ask her to hang out.

01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:35.420
She'll refuse if she doesn't want to see you.

01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:37.255
Oh...

01:09:41.259 --> 01:09:44.388
Hey... A bunch of us are going
out soon. Wanna come with?

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.905
Let's line up for that one first!

01:10:01.905 --> 01:10:03.448
Follow me, and don't fall behind!

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:06.076
Why is she taking charge?

01:10:06.076 --> 01:10:07.411
Beats me.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:08.328
Ishida.

01:10:09.454 --> 01:10:10.872
What's with her?

01:10:12.332 --> 01:10:14.543
She's acting awfully friendly.

01:10:15.168 --> 01:10:17.212
Ueno? Why?

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.465
Someone Shoko knows?

01:10:20.465 --> 01:10:22.175
Y-Yeah.

01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:24.010
From grade school.

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:32.102
Can I sit with you, Sahara?

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:33.562
Sure. Go ahead.

01:10:36.356 --> 01:10:37.816
I'm kinda scared.

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:40.360
Are you all ready?

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.778
Yeah!

01:10:42.195 --> 01:10:43.739
Here we go, then!

01:10:45.949 --> 01:10:49.453
Are you okay with having Ueno around?

01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:52.038
Oh, yeah.

01:10:52.038 --> 01:10:54.332
We're in the same design course in school.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.920
I learn so much from her artistic sense.

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:04.718
When I was in grade school,
I was too scared to ride a roller coaster.

01:11:05.218 --> 01:11:06.678
I was a coward, you see.

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:12.184
But I tried changing my perspective a little.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:17.147
I figured I could decide whether
it was scary or not after I gave it a shot.

01:11:20.066 --> 01:11:21.860
Though I am still terrified.

01:11:23.945 --> 01:11:24.863
Here it comes.

01:11:45.383 --> 01:11:47.928
Oh, no!

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:49.805
Your legs are all wobbly, Sho.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:53.517
Are you okay?

01:11:55.727 --> 01:11:57.062
Wow.

01:11:57.354 --> 01:11:58.772
You know sign language?

01:11:59.022 --> 01:12:01.566
You must've worked hard to pick it up, Ishida.

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:08.615
Hey! What's with your hand?

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:11.076
You're being rude to my Yasho!

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:13.495
What? I'm just trying to be friendly.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.413
No way! Don't think it's that easy!

01:12:15.413 --> 01:12:17.666
You're funny, Nagatsuka.

01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:21.002
Anyone who wants to approach Yasho
has to go through me!

01:12:21.002 --> 01:12:23.421
Is your hair natural?

01:12:24.422 --> 01:12:26.007
Stop it!

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:28.176
Don't touch me!

01:12:28.176 --> 01:12:29.177
Huh?

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:31.847
Run away, Mashiba!

01:12:32.138 --> 01:12:34.057
Go, Yasho! Overtake them!

01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:35.267
<i>Huh?</i>

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.021
<i>Do I have any right to have so much fun?</i>

01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:44.776
<i>But this feels kinda like...</i>

01:12:46.152 --> 01:12:47.362
What are you doing?

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:52.325
<i>You know, like a group of friends!</i>

01:12:58.039 --> 01:12:58.915
Ishida.

01:13:00.166 --> 01:13:02.252
I want takoyaki.

01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:03.920
Let's go buy some.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.089
H-Hey, wait.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.718
Here's your takoyaki.

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.761
Thank you.

01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:13.138
Look, Ueno.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.390
You don't need to play peacemaker.

01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:22.439
Die
Go away, traitor

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.026
Sh-Shimada?

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.866
Hey, Ishida?

01:13:35.952 --> 01:13:37.537
Sorry! I'll text you!

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:40.749
Ishida!

01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:42.751
Are you mad?

01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:44.336
I'm not.

01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:46.880
I'm not mad.

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:53.261
I was just hoping you two
could go back to being friends.

01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:57.724
I figured things would work out if you met.

01:13:58.266 --> 01:13:59.726
Nobody asked you.

01:14:04.105 --> 01:14:04.814
Wait.

01:14:05.815 --> 01:14:07.943
Didn't I do the exact same thing?

01:14:13.156 --> 01:14:15.533
You and I are alike.

01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:16.576
No, we're not.

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:17.869
Yes, we are.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.663
No, we're not.

01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:24.459
Hey.

01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:28.421
Everything would've been fine and dandy
if it wasn't for Nishimiya, right?

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:31.675
We don't know that.

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.134
But I do.

01:14:33.927 --> 01:14:38.848
If she wasn't around, things wouldn't have
gotten awkward between Sahara and me.

01:14:38.848 --> 01:14:41.893
And you and Shimada wouldn't have fallen out.

01:14:42.894 --> 01:14:46.147
I want to back to how things were before she came.

01:14:46.147 --> 01:14:47.565
The thing with Shimada...

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:50.777
It's all on me.

01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:54.072
Do you hate me?

01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:55.615
Probably.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:00.245
I think I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

01:15:00.578 --> 01:15:03.206
I should take Nishimiya.

01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:03.957
Hey.

01:15:05.458 --> 01:15:08.586
Nishimiya, ride the Ferris wheel with me.

01:15:08.586 --> 01:15:10.005
Wait, Ueno.

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:12.340
Take this with you, Sis.

01:15:13.049 --> 01:15:15.343
I'm riding the roller coaster again.

01:15:38.324 --> 01:15:40.952
Oh, hey. Welcome, Yuzuru.

01:15:40.952 --> 01:15:42.746
Shoya's upstairs.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:44.581
Hey.

01:15:45.081 --> 01:15:46.916
I got my hands on some top-secret footage.

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:49.669
Video of the Ferris wheel?

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.337
Yeah.

01:15:51.337 --> 01:15:53.214
What? How?

01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:54.340
Secretly filmed them.

01:15:59.971 --> 01:16:01.890
Listen.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:03.975
I hate you.

01:16:08.354 --> 01:16:09.856
Let's not.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.735
I'll talk slowly so you can understand,

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.071
and I'll pay attention to what you're saying.

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:20.325
Back in grade school,

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:24.162
I had no understanding of you or your situation.

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:28.917
But you never tried to understand me, either.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:33.213
That's why you'd obliviously
hand over your stupid notebook,

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:35.632
and have a stupid smile on your face all the time.

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:39.135
And anytime something happened,
you'd immediately apologize.

01:16:39.803 --> 01:16:43.181
So I changed my approach.

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:47.102
I ignored you and badmouthed you.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:51.106
They were signs to stay away from me.

01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:56.111
But instead of picking up on them,
you fired back.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.029
You went crying to the adults.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:02.075
Because of that, Ishida lost all his friends.

01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:06.162
Everything around us fell apart.

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:10.166
I'm Sowwy.

01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:12.836
It's not like I want you to apologize.

01:17:13.753 --> 01:17:16.256
We were doing everything we could back then,

01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:19.717
and looking back, I even feel like maybe
it was inevitable how things turned out.

01:17:19.717 --> 01:17:24.597
But I'm not about to tell you
we should be friends now.

01:17:24.597 --> 01:17:27.308
I still hate you,

01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:29.352
and you hate me.

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:33.606
So how about we take it easy from now on?

01:17:33.606 --> 01:17:36.484
Let's shake hands as two people
who hate each other.

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:40.029
Y-You're wrog.

01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:43.533
I hade mysel.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.161
What the heck?

01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:48.955
What the hell is up with that?

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.419
So what?

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:56.963
Are you going to apologize again?

01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:00.884
In the end, things are the same as five years ago.

01:18:00.884 --> 01:18:02.802
You're not even trying to talk to me.

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:10.643
What do you think?

01:18:11.227 --> 01:18:13.730
Oh, uh...

01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:21.404
I want Nishimiya to come to love herself.

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.749
Ueno, was it?

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:34.375
What about her?

01:18:35.126 --> 01:18:38.421
Did something happen
between her and Nishimiya?

01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:40.131
Huh? Why do you ask?

01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:43.635
Kawai said things were complicated
in grade school.

01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:49.349
Nishimiya really can't hear, huh?

01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:51.559
Yeah.

01:18:51.559 --> 01:18:55.813
Wait, is that why she was bullied?

01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:01.569
I can't stand stuff like that.

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:03.863
Don't you agree, Ishida?

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.241
Huh? What do you mean?

01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:09.702
Are you saying I'm going around
telling people about the past?

01:19:09.702 --> 01:19:11.663
Ch-Chill. You're being too loud.

01:19:13.831 --> 01:19:16.668
You haven't changed one bit.

01:19:17.543 --> 01:19:19.629
You were and still are a colossal jerk!

01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:20.338
What's wrong, Yasho?
You were and still are a colossal jerk!

01:19:20.338 --> 01:19:21.047
What's wrong, Yasho?

01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:22.507
Calm down, Kawai.

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:24.050
What're you talking about?

01:19:24.425 --> 01:19:29.681
Mishiba, Ishida once bullied a girl.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.227
What are you saying, Kawai?

01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:36.271
That can't be...

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:37.355
It's true!

01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:41.317
You badmouthed her yourself.

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:45.071
I never badmouthed Nishimiya.

01:19:45.613 --> 01:19:46.698
Nishimiya?

01:19:46.698 --> 01:19:50.743
That's right! Ishida bullied Nishimiya!

01:19:52.704 --> 01:19:56.207
You know, I tried to stop him.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:59.711
But he just wouldn't listen.

01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:02.171
It was so scary.

01:20:04.173 --> 01:20:05.425
Yasho?

01:20:05.925 --> 01:20:07.302
You ok?

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.304
Sorry, Nagatsuka.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.388
Yasho?

01:20:12.348 --> 01:20:13.641
Yasho!

01:20:42.295 --> 01:20:44.964
<i>Yeah, I hate myself too.</i>

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:58.436
Oh, Ishida.

01:20:58.436 --> 01:20:59.020
Hey.

01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.440
Something wrong?

01:21:03.733 --> 01:21:05.360
N-Nothing.

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:07.653
Really.

01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:11.366
There you are, Ishida!

01:21:11.741 --> 01:21:13.910
I brought your bag.

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:14.744
Heya.

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:16.079
Nao?

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.748
I called her.

01:21:22.585 --> 01:21:24.462
Sorry about earlier.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:29.550
But it was all your fault to begin with.

01:21:30.718 --> 01:21:38.142
Still, Mashiba said I should forgive you
if you apologized to Nishimiya.

01:21:38.142 --> 01:21:39.477
Wait a second.

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:42.188
That's messed up.

01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:45.942
What right do we have to criticize Ishida over it?

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.152
"We"?

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.488
You've got it wrong, Nao.

01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:51.364
Got what wrong?

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:57.036
Unlike me, you went out of your way
to bully Nishimiya.

01:21:57.286 --> 01:21:59.330
Don't lump me in with you.

01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:01.541
Nao...

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:03.626
Ah.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.087
Yeah.

01:22:06.462 --> 01:22:10.383
I'm not like you at all. You just laughed
and fell in line with what I was doing!

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:12.593
Mean!

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.929
What do you think, Sahara?

01:22:15.596 --> 01:22:16.806
You're asking me?

01:22:16.806 --> 01:22:20.226
Nao badmouthed you a ton too, Sahara!

01:22:20.226 --> 01:22:22.228
I was only telling the truth!

01:22:23.604 --> 01:22:26.190
Out with it, Sahara.

01:22:26.816 --> 01:22:28.734
I-I ...

01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:33.406
I was scared of you both back then.

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:35.741
What? Whose side are you on?

01:22:35.741 --> 01:22:37.452
Neither of you!

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:38.327
Enough.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:43.374
It's all my fault.

01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:46.878
I hate that line of thinking.

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:48.838
Ueno.

01:22:50.047 --> 01:22:53.342
Stop thinking you can decide everything for others.

01:22:54.218 --> 01:22:55.887
You don't have to put it like that.

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:57.430
Shut up, Sahara.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:23:00.641
You're just gonna run and regret
your cowardice again, anyway.

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.227
What's gotten into you, Ishida?

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.605
Not another word, Kawai.

01:23:06.272 --> 01:23:09.817
All you've ever cared about is yourself.

01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:11.402
Yasho...

01:23:11.402 --> 01:23:13.613
I'm on your side, okay.

01:23:14.197 --> 01:23:17.909
Oh, buzz off. You don't know
the first thing about me.

01:23:18.618 --> 01:23:20.995
I've had it! I'm leaving!

01:23:22.205 --> 01:23:23.247
Yasho...

01:23:24.957 --> 01:23:25.875
It's okay.

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:28.586
It doesn't bother me.

01:23:30.087 --> 01:23:31.130
Sho.

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:33.424
See you.

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:41.682
Sorry, Ishida.

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.019
I shouldn't have come.

01:23:48.397 --> 01:23:50.191
Ishida, you're too awful.

01:23:52.652 --> 01:23:55.154
Keep your nose out of it, outsider.

01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:58.449
And here I thought we were friends.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.421
Right.

01:24:13.464 --> 01:24:17.093
Summer break starts next week.

01:24:17.843 --> 01:24:19.845
Wanna go somewhere...

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:38.531
I don't care. I'm sorry. Are
you listening to me?! I'm sorry.

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.074
Yuzu?

01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:44.787
Your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark.

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:51.168
Here.

01:24:58.342 --> 01:25:01.887
Are you still worried about your sister?

01:25:04.557 --> 01:25:07.643
Meanwhile, I'm worried about you.

01:25:07.893 --> 01:25:09.687
All you care about is your sister.

01:25:09.687 --> 01:25:13.065
You're not at all trying to figure out
who you are as a person.

01:25:14.066 --> 01:25:15.985
Like you're any better.

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:20.281
You're skipping out on the senior citizen
meets to learn sign language.

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:24.577
I'm doing it for myself, so it doesn't count.

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:28.414
Then I'm doing it for myself too.

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.083
Is that so?

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.464
You're a good girl.

01:25:37.048 --> 01:25:37.882
You think?

01:25:38.424 --> 01:25:41.260
Mom keeps yelling at me every day.

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:43.220
I haven't gone to school in forever, too.

01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:46.057
Your heart is pure.

01:25:46.932 --> 01:25:48.768
Shoko's hanging in there too.

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:54.774
I've been blessed with
truly amazing granddaughters.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.529
Have some steamed buns.

01:26:00.529 --> 01:26:01.739
I will.

01:26:16.587 --> 01:26:17.505
Grandma...

01:26:30.226 --> 01:26:32.228
Hey, Nishimiya. How are you doing?

01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:37.274
I got some really nice bread today.

01:26:37.858 --> 01:26:39.485
This bread...

01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:44.740
It's good, like you.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:45.783
So...

01:26:47.326 --> 01:26:48.577
What the heck?

01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:50.496
Huh?

01:26:52.498 --> 01:26:54.041
Isn't she coming today?

01:26:57.461 --> 01:26:58.462
Er...

01:26:59.046 --> 01:27:01.340
Do you have another stomach ache?

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:03.342
Wait, that's weird.

01:27:13.185 --> 01:27:15.396
Hey, Yuzu !

01:27:29.285 --> 01:27:30.161
Guess I'll go home.

01:27:30.161 --> 01:27:31.120
Ishida.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:32.997
Heya.

01:27:33.456 --> 01:27:35.040
What's with that outfit?

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.293
It's a uniform, obviously.

01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:38.836
How do I look?

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:39.879
Why?

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:41.088
School, duh.

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.800
Aren't we on summer break right now?

01:27:47.219 --> 01:27:48.929
Seriously, what's up?

01:27:51.182 --> 01:27:52.433
Nothing.

01:27:52.892 --> 01:27:55.436
If I had to say, I'm in cosplay.

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:01.275
It's from Sis. Gotta go.

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.777
I'll walk you. Where to?

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.986
You don't have to.

01:28:04.361 --> 01:28:05.279
Let me.

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.864
Really, you don't have to.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.283
I saw you crying earlier.

01:28:10.242 --> 01:28:10.951
Why?

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:15.831
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:20.628
It does, or so I'd like to think.

01:28:21.003 --> 01:28:21.796
And why is that?

01:28:22.713 --> 01:28:24.256
Because I'm worried about you.

01:28:26.383 --> 01:28:28.844
Don't start talking like my grandma.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.098
Do whatever you want.

01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:38.437
Thanks, Ishida.

01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:41.982
I'll be fine from here.

01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:44.652

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:45.069
Later.
Ito Nishimiya Funeral

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:53.160
Hang in there, Yuzuru.

01:28:56.872 --> 01:28:57.790
Ishida.

01:29:02.002 --> 01:29:03.671
I'm still scared.

01:30:03.188 --> 01:30:05.900
Hey, Nishimiya.
Would you like to go somewhere tomorrow?

01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:00.996
Awesome!

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:05.542
Let's go check it out.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.220
Nishimiya?

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.146
That scared me.

01:31:29.191 --> 01:31:30.359
Why are you apologizing?

01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:38.409
Of course not!

01:31:38.951 --> 01:31:42.371
Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.

01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:43.956
Okay, Nishimiya?

01:31:47.918 --> 01:31:52.506
<i>She said I'd end up unhappy if I was with her.</i>

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.929
<i>This, to the root cause of her unhappiness.</i>

01:32:07.438 --> 01:32:11.650
I wanna see the ocean.

01:32:12.901 --> 01:32:17.239
I wanna love people.

01:32:18.407 --> 01:32:24.371
Even monsters have hearts...

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.711
I don't feel like I can ever fix this.

01:32:35.424 --> 01:32:36.175
Hey, Nishimiya!

01:32:36.425 --> 01:32:39.011
Oh, Yuzuru's coming today? Great!

01:32:39.261 --> 01:32:40.596
Shall we go watch a movie?

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.474
This is great!

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:44.349
Hey.

01:32:44.808 --> 01:32:45.934
I'm here.

01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:49.730
Man, best summer break ever!

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.856
Right, Yuzuru?

01:32:50.856 --> 01:32:51.732
Don't ask me.

01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:54.401
I'm really enjoying my time, seriously.

01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:55.652
Hey, Nishimiya.

01:32:55.652 --> 01:32:57.404
Where are we going tomorrow?

01:32:57.404 --> 01:32:59.031
We should totally go somewhere.

01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:01.742
Not tomorrow. We have plans.

01:33:02.367 --> 01:33:02.701
What?

01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:06.413
Are you crazy?!

01:33:06.413 --> 01:33:06.997
What are you making?
Are you crazy?!

01:33:06.997 --> 01:33:07.664
What are you making?

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.249
Are you sure about this?

01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:11.877
Should I really be here?

01:33:11.877 --> 01:33:16.590
Your mission is to help us bake
a birthday cake for our mother.

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:19.343
A-Are you really, really sure?

01:33:19.343 --> 01:33:21.136
Won't I get slapped again?

01:33:21.136 --> 01:33:23.847
Uh, forget slapped. You might get killed.

01:33:23.847 --> 01:33:25.349
Hey...

01:33:25.349 --> 01:33:28.393
That looks great!

01:33:30.437 --> 01:33:31.480
What are you doing?

01:33:31.814 --> 01:33:33.816
Why is this boy here, Shoko?

01:33:33.816 --> 01:33:35.067
What are you trying to pull?

01:33:35.067 --> 01:33:36.026
There, there, Mom.
Get out.

01:33:36.026 --> 01:33:37.402
There, there, Mom.

01:33:37.402 --> 01:33:40.114
What's the big deal? It's a happy occasion.

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.406
Yuzuru.

01:33:41.406 --> 01:33:42.449
You look good.

01:33:49.915 --> 01:33:51.250
Yum!

01:33:51.667 --> 01:33:54.336
Looks like you avoided getting killed, Ishida.

01:33:54.586 --> 01:33:55.879
Y-Yeah.

01:33:55.879 --> 01:33:57.798
We did it, Sis.

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.550
By the way, Yuzuru.

01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:03.428
I picked a photo and submitted it
to the prefectural photography contest.

01:34:03.428 --> 01:34:05.013
Wait, what?

01:34:05.013 --> 01:34:06.807
Sho said you should take part.

01:34:10.686 --> 01:34:13.689
What? They're all weird photos.

01:34:13.689 --> 01:34:15.274
That's not what I found.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.986
Who asked you two?

01:34:19.903 --> 01:34:20.737
Oh, right.

01:34:21.113 --> 01:34:23.824
There's a fireworks show next Tuesday, Ishida.

01:34:26.285 --> 01:34:27.911
Nah, I'll pass.

01:34:27.911 --> 01:34:29.371
Come on. Let's go.

01:34:42.342 --> 01:34:43.552
Will this do?

01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:44.553
Yeah.

01:35:13.498 --> 01:35:16.335
Oh, I'll go get some yakisoba.

01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:17.419
Come with me, Mom.

01:35:29.598 --> 01:35:30.515
Thanks.

01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:35.395
Oh, and thank you for
inviting me over the other day.

01:35:35.395 --> 01:35:36.605
Was your mother...

01:35:36.605 --> 01:35:39.691
Yeah. You think she was happy?

01:35:39.691 --> 01:35:41.568
I couldn't tell from her poker face.

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:45.906
When is your birthday?

01:35:47.532 --> 01:35:49.910
June 7th?

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:52.287
It already passed!

01:35:52.287 --> 01:35:55.791
So you're already eighteen, huh?

01:35:56.458 --> 01:36:00.504
Let's celebrate your nineteenth together, okay?

01:36:00.504 --> 01:36:02.798
I went and said "together"!

01:36:27.489 --> 01:36:30.033
Oh, is that so?

01:36:31.535 --> 01:36:32.911
I see...

01:36:35.414 --> 01:36:36.373
What's up?

01:36:41.503 --> 01:36:44.673
But the show isn't over yet.

01:36:47.217 --> 01:36:48.218
You need to study?

01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:50.804
Oh, okay.

01:36:51.221 --> 01:36:53.557
I'll walk you.

01:36:54.933 --> 01:36:55.726
But...

01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:03.525
All right.

01:37:03.525 --> 01:37:05.152
See you.

01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:16.455
Huh?

01:37:16.913 --> 01:37:18.248
Where's Sis?

01:37:19.207 --> 01:37:20.834
That reminds me, Ishida.

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.544
Could you go get my camera for me?

01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:39.102
Pardon me...

01:37:39.102 --> 01:37:40.479
Whoa, it's dark.

01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:42.189
Nishimiya?

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.732
I'm coming in.

01:37:44.816 --> 01:37:46.068
There it is.

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:49.154
Is it charged?

01:37:50.572 --> 01:37:52.157
You can see the fireworks from here...?

01:37:53.658 --> 01:37:55.952
Oh, she is here.

01:37:57.829 --> 01:37:58.622
Nishimiya?

01:37:59.623 --> 01:38:00.290
Nishimiya?

01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:03.251
W-W-Wait a second.

01:38:03.668 --> 01:38:05.921
What are you doing, Nishimiya?

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:10.550
Nishimiya?

01:38:22.813 --> 01:38:23.438
Nishimiya!

01:38:30.612 --> 01:38:31.822
Nishimiya!

01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:35.742
Shoko!

01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:01.059
Why...

01:39:01.059 --> 01:39:02.686
Why, Nishimiya?

01:39:07.649 --> 01:39:10.026
Nishimiya, grab the ledge!

01:39:10.986 --> 01:39:11.820
<i>I beg you, God.</i>

01:39:13.071 --> 01:39:16.450
<i>Please give mo one lest ounce of strength.</i>

01:39:18.076 --> 01:39:20.412
<i>I won't run away from things anymore.</i>

01:39:21.705 --> 01:39:23.123
<i>From tomorrow,</i>

01:39:23.498 --> 01:39:25.584
<i>I'll look at people's faces.</i>

01:39:26.501 --> 01:39:30.046
<i>From tomorrow, I'll listen to their voices.</i>

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:34.468
<i>From tomorrow, I promise to do things right.</i>

01:39:35.385 --> 01:39:37.387
Nishimiya...

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:42.476
<i>I gave her that scar back then.</i>

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.562
<i>Did I ever actually apologize to her?</i>

01:39:47.063 --> 01:39:47.939
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:39:48.523 --> 01:39:49.983
<i>I'm sorry, Nishimiya.</i>

01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:52.194
<i>Are you still mad?</i>

01:39:52.819 --> 01:39:55.238
<i>Man, I really messed up.</i>

01:39:55.822 --> 01:40:00.202
<i>I should've asked her how she felt about me.</i>

01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:03.163
<i>By the way, Nishimiya.</i>

01:40:04.206 --> 01:40:04.873
<i>You see, I...</i>

01:40:17.886 --> 01:40:18.845
Sho.

01:40:19.137 --> 01:40:22.140
Your sister made pancakes.

01:40:22.599 --> 01:40:24.768
I'm gonna see the fireworks!

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.406
<i>So cold...</i>

01:40:39.491 --> 01:40:40.784
<i>Yet so warm...</i>

01:40:51.878 --> 01:40:53.588
Suimon Municipal Hospital

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:07.852
Auntie!

01:41:08.728 --> 01:41:10.397
Oh, Yuzuru.

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:12.482
I finally got to see you.

01:41:13.024 --> 01:41:15.360
I called the shop, but nobody answered.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.529
And the hospital said no visits.

01:41:18.613 --> 01:41:20.615
Oh, you can see him now.

01:41:20.615 --> 01:41:22.492
They moved him to a ward room today.

01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:25.745
Come with me. Let him see your face.

01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:28.248
You see, Shoko...

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:28.999
Ishida.

01:41:30.208 --> 01:41:31.209
Nishimiya?

01:41:32.961 --> 01:41:35.839
Uh, I'm very sorry.

01:41:35.839 --> 01:41:39.092
We caused you trouble once again.

01:41:40.135 --> 01:41:41.720
I'm truly sorry.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.721
Please don't!

01:41:43.305 --> 01:41:46.474
I'm sure my son did something to Shoko again.

01:41:46.474 --> 01:41:47.225
Otherwise...

01:41:47.225 --> 01:41:51.521
Auntie, he saved my stupid sister.

01:41:52.063 --> 01:41:54.566
I was too negligent.

01:41:55.066 --> 01:41:56.359
I'm sorry.

01:41:59.487 --> 01:42:00.488
Please...

01:42:01.656 --> 01:42:03.450
Please raise your head.

01:42:04.034 --> 01:42:06.369
I'm just glad Shoko's all right.

01:42:06.995 --> 01:42:09.331
You too, Yuzuru.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.583
Please, I beg you.

01:42:13.168 --> 01:42:16.421
Why did Ishida have to get hurt?!

01:42:17.339 --> 01:42:19.633
Quit trying to be some tragic heroine!

01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:22.385
Say something.

01:42:22.927 --> 01:42:27.432
"I caused everyone trouble
and was really hurt by it,

01:42:27.432 --> 01:42:29.726
so I tried to commit suicide.

01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:31.394
I'm sorry," huh?

01:42:32.103 --> 01:42:33.605
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:42:34.439 --> 01:42:37.609
You're a cancer, Nishimiya.

01:42:38.026 --> 01:42:42.447
People like you, who can only see things
from their own point of view,

01:42:42.447 --> 01:42:44.282
piss me off the most!

01:42:50.205 --> 01:42:51.748
And who the hell are you?!

01:42:55.377 --> 01:42:58.046
Are you her mother?!

01:42:58.421 --> 01:42:59.005
Stop...

01:42:59.005 --> 01:43:02.592
Don't have kids if you can't take care of them!

01:43:02.592 --> 01:43:03.385
What are you doing?

01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:06.471
Stop it.

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:10.308
Stop it!

01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:11.768
Why?

01:43:12.644 --> 01:43:13.937
What is wrong with you two?

01:43:26.116 --> 01:43:27.951
Are you Shoko?

01:43:31.079 --> 01:43:33.415
Soww...

01:43:34.582 --> 01:43:36.084
I'm Sowwy...

01:43:38.169 --> 01:43:40.088
I'm so Sowwy!

01:43:43.258 --> 01:43:44.759
I'm so Sowwy!

01:43:49.514 --> 01:43:52.308
I'm so Sowwy!

01:44:05.447 --> 01:44:06.656
What are you doing?

01:44:07.949 --> 01:44:12.996
I used to think Sis would stop talking about
wanting to die if she saw these.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.127
What was I supposed to do?

01:45:08.384 --> 01:45:09.594
It's not opening.

01:45:09.594 --> 01:45:11.012
She's holding it shut!

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:13.807
Oh, didn't see you there, Nishimiya.

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:17.018
Shall we head someplace else?
I'll get you a drink.

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:20.396
I heard about what happened with Yasho.

01:45:23.233 --> 01:45:26.194
I destroyed everything Ishida had built up

01:45:26.528 --> 01:45:28.905
You mean what happened at the bridge?

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:34.202
Yasho accepted a weirdo like me.

01:45:34.619 --> 01:45:39.249
He made me realize for the first time
what a best friend was.

01:45:43.753 --> 01:45:49.175
Yasho's my big friend,
so I really need him to wake up.

01:45:57.058 --> 01:46:00.812
I want to fix what I destroyed

01:46:06.609 --> 01:46:09.404
Trying to kill yourself 'cause
you're having a hard time is messed up!

01:46:09.779 --> 01:46:12.198
Kawai, you're being too loud.

01:46:12.198 --> 01:46:16.369
She won't hear me unless I yell!

01:46:18.329 --> 01:46:20.540
We were so worried!

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.419
Everyone goes through difficulties in life.

01:46:24.919 --> 01:46:27.213
But we're all in the same boat, aren't we?

01:46:27.213 --> 01:46:33.720
You have to learn to love even the things
you hate about yourself and move forward.

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.475
I'm glad you're all right.

01:46:40.977 --> 01:46:42.937
I want to fix what I destroyed

01:46:42.937 --> 01:46:43.938
I see.
I want to fix what I destroyed

01:46:44.230 --> 01:46:46.649
You went and saw everyone, huh?

01:46:46.858 --> 01:46:47.901
You're strong.

01:46:50.361 --> 01:46:53.114
I'm not as strong as you.

01:46:53.740 --> 01:47:00.371
Even when Ishida does wake up,
I won't know how to face him.

01:47:00.663 --> 01:47:03.458
I couldn't change.

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:06.169
I failed to protect you again!

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:07.921
I'm still the same old coward.

01:47:09.714 --> 01:47:11.841
You gan jange from now,

01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:15.595
Tahada...

01:47:18.723 --> 01:47:21.309
Thank you for coming, Sho.

01:48:03.851 --> 01:48:06.521
Jeez, cut that out.

01:48:15.446 --> 01:48:16.990
Nishimiya.

01:48:17.699 --> 01:48:19.867
Found you.

01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:23.871
How are you doing?

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:25.748
You know,

01:48:26.207 --> 01:48:28.876
this is kinda weird, huh?

01:48:29.335 --> 01:48:30.253
I ...

01:48:30.586 --> 01:48:32.755
wanted to die...

01:48:33.423 --> 01:48:34.382
Oh.

01:48:34.966 --> 01:48:37.635
Tuesday will be over soon.

01:48:38.344 --> 01:48:40.013
Later,

01:48:40.096 --> 01:48:41.055
Nishimiya.

01:49:45.203 --> 01:49:46.079
Nihimiya!

01:49:49.457 --> 01:49:50.333
What's all this?

01:49:51.417 --> 01:49:52.460
Mom?

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.962
Get this crap off me!

01:50:03.262 --> 01:50:04.347
Nishimiya...

01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:08.059
Nishimiya.

01:50:17.026 --> 01:50:18.027
Nishimiya...

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:19.904
Nishimiya...

01:50:22.824 --> 01:50:24.325
Nishimiya...

01:50:38.923 --> 01:50:39.799
Hey.

01:51:22.967 --> 01:51:23.885
Are you okay?

01:51:30.474 --> 01:51:31.142
Great.

01:51:32.518 --> 01:51:35.813
I'm glad you're fine.

01:51:40.359 --> 01:51:41.360
Nishimiya,

01:51:41.736 --> 01:51:44.405
I'm all good now.

01:51:45.823 --> 01:51:47.116
More or less.

01:51:49.410 --> 01:51:52.705
Come on. Don't cry.

01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:54.415
Oh, right.

01:51:57.793 --> 01:51:58.920
Nishimiya,

01:52:01.172 --> 01:52:02.590
I'm sorry.

01:52:03.257 --> 01:52:07.720
I hadn't actually apologized to you
for what I did to you in the past.

01:52:08.971 --> 01:52:13.351
Or everything after that, either.

01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:22.610
I'd probably created a convenient
image of you in my head.

01:52:23.194 --> 01:52:27.949
I wanted to talk to you more.

01:52:29.992 --> 01:52:32.453
That was probably all.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:36.707
But I hurt you

01:52:37.583 --> 01:52:41.170
and forced you into making
the worst possible choice.

01:52:42.964 --> 01:52:43.798
No!

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:48.844
You fell becas I couldn jange!

01:52:49.428 --> 01:52:54.433
Id all my fauld!

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:59.814
If only I were gone...

01:53:01.315 --> 01:53:04.235
I'm so Sowwy!

01:53:04.235 --> 01:53:06.529
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

01:53:10.324 --> 01:53:12.535
Listen, Nishimiya.

01:53:17.081 --> 01:53:20.960
I was talking to you before coming here.

01:53:22.378 --> 01:53:23.796
It was within a dream.

01:53:24.338 --> 01:53:28.009
Looks like I was trying to give up on everything.

01:53:29.093 --> 01:53:31.220
But that wasn't right.

01:53:32.179 --> 01:53:36.475
I'd felt the same way as you forever,

01:53:37.643 --> 01:53:45.109
but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.

01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:50.281
I want to apologize to the others too.

01:53:52.908 --> 01:53:56.662
Hey, Nishimiya. I ...

01:54:00.249 --> 01:54:05.963
I want you to help me live.

01:54:14.972 --> 01:54:15.973
Nishimiya.

01:54:37.828 --> 01:54:38.496
H-Huh?

01:54:39.163 --> 01:54:42.166
Did I just do something really creepy?

01:54:42.166 --> 01:54:43.626
Crap!

01:54:43.626 --> 01:54:45.878
S-Sorry! Forget it!

01:54:45.878 --> 01:54:47.671
Forget what I just said!

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:14.698
We've reached your destination, sir.

01:55:15.825 --> 01:55:19.161
Oh, Maria. You're watering the flowers?

01:55:19.161 --> 01:55:20.788
Atta girl.

01:55:21.747 --> 01:55:25.835
Are you gonna die?!

01:55:25.835 --> 01:55:29.338
Maria, Sho came back to life.

01:55:29.338 --> 01:55:31.382
I'm not dead, Maria.

01:55:31.382 --> 01:55:33.759
Isn't that Ueno?

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:38.681
She nursed you the entire time, you know.

01:55:39.056 --> 01:55:40.433
Go thank her.

01:55:43.352 --> 01:55:45.146
I hear you came to visit.

01:55:45.813 --> 01:55:48.732
I'm a really awful person.

01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:56.198
Even in this situation,
I just couldn't bring myself to like Nishimiya.

01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:59.160
Guess I don't have to.

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:04.665
Oh, Shimada and Hirose were the ones
who pulled you up when you fell.

01:56:05.875 --> 01:56:07.918
They asked me not to tell you,
but screw that.

01:56:09.044 --> 01:56:09.837
Ishida...

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:12.590
Welcome back.

01:56:12.923 --> 01:56:14.675
Well, I'm out.

01:56:16.343 --> 01:56:17.178
Thank you.

01:56:26.896 --> 01:56:29.023
Gosh. You've cut it too short!

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:32.026
This suits you much better.

01:56:32.026 --> 01:56:33.694
Oh, welcome back, Sho.

01:56:33.694 --> 01:56:34.737
Thanks for having me.

01:56:34.737 --> 01:56:36.447
W-Welcome.

01:56:38.741 --> 01:56:39.742
Ishida.

01:56:39.742 --> 01:56:40.284
Yes?

01:56:41.285 --> 01:56:42.703
I'm sorry.

01:56:42.703 --> 01:56:43.996
Oh, no...

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:45.164
I'm sorry too.

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:47.458
That's right. My son is invincible.

01:56:47.458 --> 01:56:48.417
Moms!

01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:50.211
I'll go pick up Maria.

01:56:50.211 --> 01:56:51.295
Sure.

01:56:51.295 --> 01:56:51.879
Who is that?

01:56:51.879 --> 01:56:54.381
Hello, and make yourself at home.
My daughter's husband. He came back.

01:56:54.965 --> 01:56:56.383
Oh, Sho.

01:56:56.383 --> 01:56:57.843
Yuzu's upstairs.

01:56:58.302 --> 01:57:00.429
Give her the jelly in the fridge.

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:01.889
Hey.

01:57:03.641 --> 01:57:04.683
Winter uniform?

01:57:04.683 --> 01:57:05.768
Looks good.

01:57:05.768 --> 01:57:07.269
Get a load of this, Ishida.

01:57:07.269 --> 01:57:08.020
Photography Contest Student Prize
Winner Yuzuru Nishimiya (9th grade)

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:10.231
Are you serious? That's crazy! Photography Contest
Student Prize Winner Yuzuru Nishimiya (9th grade)

01:57:10.397 --> 01:57:11.690
Get a load of this too.

01:57:12.608 --> 01:57:14.401
Are you serious? That's crazy...

01:57:14.568 --> 01:57:15.986
I beg ya, boss!

01:57:15.986 --> 01:57:18.113
Please tutor me!

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:19.573
Sure.

01:57:23.410 --> 01:57:26.080
You started going to school, huh?

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.791
Shoko broke the ice for me.

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:33.379
Well, I'll give it my best shot.

01:57:33.712 --> 01:57:35.589
I wanna live up to her expectations.

01:57:37.925 --> 01:57:39.927
I hear your school festival starts tomorrow?

01:57:40.302 --> 01:57:41.929
Yeah, you heard right.

01:57:47.518 --> 01:57:49.728
From: Shoko Nishimiya Hello Everyone was talking about going to your school's festival
tomorrow. I'll be waiting by the front gates at 10. Yuzuru and Mom will come later.

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.190
M-Morning, guys.

01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:54.233
How've you been?

01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:59.071
I'm sorry I said all those mean things.

01:58:07.204 --> 01:58:07.913
Let's do this!

01:58:08.455 --> 01:58:09.456
I'm off.

01:58:09.456 --> 01:58:10.499
Take care.

01:58:11.834 --> 01:58:14.545
Is that how they're used?

01:58:14.545 --> 01:58:15.462
What?

01:58:15.462 --> 01:58:16.589
Nothing.

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.007
Later.

01:58:18.007 --> 01:58:19.675
Have a nice day!

01:58:35.983 --> 01:58:36.775
Morning.

01:58:40.321 --> 01:58:41.113
Shall we?

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.166
Isn't that Ishida?

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:53.959
Who?

01:58:54.209 --> 01:58:55.544
The one who was hospitalized?

01:58:55.544 --> 01:58:56.754
The jumper?

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.845
I've never told you this before,

01:59:04.845 --> 01:59:07.723
but I don't fit in at school.

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:14.855
I can't look at people's faces.

01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:19.068
So I feel much better when I look down.

01:59:22.571 --> 01:59:24.365
I can keep looking down?

01:59:27.034 --> 01:59:28.410
N-Nishimiya...

01:59:28.911 --> 01:59:31.205
I can walk just fine.

01:59:32.206 --> 01:59:33.791
Thanks, Nishimiya.

01:59:34.124 --> 01:59:35.626
This is my class.

01:59:37.628 --> 01:59:39.213
Is the water ready?

01:59:39.213 --> 01:59:40.798
Gimme a bit more.

01:59:41.423 --> 01:59:42.466
Ishida?

01:59:42.466 --> 01:59:43.759
It's Ishida!

01:59:44.385 --> 01:59:45.803
Are you okay now?

01:59:48.138 --> 01:59:49.515
Nishimiya...

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:52.851
I think my tummy hurts.

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:55.145
Sorry.

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:56.438
Yasho!

02:00:09.618 --> 02:00:10.703
Yasho?

02:00:12.246 --> 02:00:13.664
Nagatsuka?

02:00:13.997 --> 02:00:15.999
Yasho, do you have a stomach ache?

02:00:18.961 --> 02:00:19.753
Yasho...

02:00:20.337 --> 02:00:22.673
Hey, Nagatsuka. Morning.

02:00:22.673 --> 02:00:23.590
How're you doing?

02:00:24.091 --> 02:00:24.633
The other day

02:00:24.633 --> 02:00:25.342
Why are you looking down?
The other day

02:00:25.342 --> 02:00:27.803
Why are you looking down?

02:00:27.803 --> 02:00:30.055
Huh? That's weird.

02:00:30.514 --> 02:00:33.517
I actually meant to look you straight in the eye.

02:00:34.143 --> 02:00:35.352
D-Did I get cold feet?

02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:37.563
Hey, Yasho.

02:00:38.147 --> 02:00:39.064
Ishida!

02:00:40.190 --> 02:00:42.359
I'm so glad you're all right!

02:00:43.902 --> 02:00:45.404
If you...

02:00:46.155 --> 02:00:51.410
If you hadn't woken up,
it would've been all over for me!

02:00:52.202 --> 02:00:52.870
Yasho!

02:00:53.162 --> 02:00:56.331
Don't worry about what happened on the bridge!

02:00:56.623 --> 02:00:59.543
Those things happen in life.

02:01:00.085 --> 02:01:02.546
So please, Yasho...

02:01:02.921 --> 02:01:05.382
Don't go anywhere!

02:01:05.382 --> 02:01:07.134
I beg you!

02:01:07.134 --> 02:01:08.260
Nagatsuka...

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:13.807
I'm sorry about everything.

02:01:15.309 --> 02:01:18.312
Also, thank you.

02:01:18.645 --> 02:01:19.772
Yasho.

02:01:19.772 --> 02:01:20.606
Oh, and ...

02:01:21.064 --> 02:01:22.691
What's with the mustache?

02:01:23.233 --> 02:01:27.404
A prayer so you'd wake up as soon as possible.

02:01:27.905 --> 02:01:29.239
Nagatsuka...

02:01:35.829 --> 02:01:36.872
What's up?

02:01:36.872 --> 02:01:40.626
I heard Nagatsuka screaming out your name.

02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:42.503
Oh.

02:01:43.253 --> 02:01:46.673
Kawai, you should hand them to him.

02:01:46.673 --> 02:01:47.508
You got them?

02:01:47.508 --> 02:01:51.970
I brought them, but I can't give him those.
They came out really badly.

02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:54.681
It's fine. Hand them over.

02:02:00.062 --> 02:02:00.562
Here.

02:02:02.231 --> 02:02:06.902
I actually wanted to make
a thousand of these, but I couldn't.

02:02:07.236 --> 02:02:10.030
I asked everyone, but...

02:02:10.447 --> 02:02:11.865
Sorry...

02:02:11.865 --> 02:02:13.617
N-Nah, it's amazing!

02:02:13.617 --> 02:02:14.868
This is plenty!

02:02:14.868 --> 02:02:17.204
I've never got anything like this before,

02:02:17.204 --> 02:02:19.081
so it makes me really happy.

02:02:19.623 --> 02:02:21.250
Thank you, Kawai.

02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:23.293
And I'm sorry.

02:02:23.293 --> 02:02:24.419
You too, Mashiba.

02:02:24.962 --> 02:02:27.381
Nah. You're amazing.

02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:29.591
Yikes. So gross.

02:02:29.591 --> 02:02:30.843
Playing friends, are we?

02:02:31.301 --> 02:02:32.719
You're making my skin crawl.

02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:35.347
Why do you have to be like that?

02:02:35.597 --> 02:02:36.348
Huh?

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:38.851
What's your problem, Kawai?
You wanna go?

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:41.186
Come on, you two.

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:43.105
Ishida...

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:45.566
I'm sorry.

02:02:45.899 --> 02:02:48.443
You were going through so much,
but I was no help.

02:02:49.570 --> 02:02:51.029
I haven't changed at all.

02:02:52.614 --> 02:02:53.490
Come on.

02:02:54.491 --> 02:02:55.826
I'm the same.

02:02:57.119 --> 02:03:00.122
They're not talking about anything serious.

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.167
You apologized again.

02:03:05.502 --> 02:03:07.629
Well, I guess that's just who you are.

02:03:09.006 --> 02:03:10.674
Dumbass.

02:03:15.304 --> 02:03:17.014
Dumbass.

02:03:17.598 --> 02:03:19.182
Dumbass.

02:03:25.314 --> 02:03:27.107
Oh, forget it.

02:03:27.107 --> 02:03:28.442
I'll go get some fried chicken.

02:03:28.775 --> 02:03:29.860
She ran away.

02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.153
She was too embarrassed.

02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:37.618
Listen, I've got a favor to ask of you all.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.119
May I?

02:03:40.704 --> 02:03:44.875
I'd like us to check out the festival together.

02:04:04.186 --> 02:04:06.146
God, this is seriously yummy!

02:04:06.146 --> 02:04:08.023
Let's check out the gym next.

02:04:08.482 --> 02:04:10.776
How can he come to school?

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:13.445
Hey, Class B's stall is seriously great.

02:04:13.445 --> 02:04:14.279
Count me in.

02:05:57.674 --> 02:06:00.719
<i>"Fell in love as"</i>

02:06:00.844 --> 02:06:07.392
<i>Ah... I fell in love...</i>

02:06:25.452 --> 02:06:28.205
<i>Well, please raise your face</i>

02:06:28.205 --> 02:06:32.375
<i>Then you can see I am here in front of you</i>

02:06:32.375 --> 02:06:37.172
<i>So stop crying any more</i>

02:06:41.259 --> 02:06:47.766
<i>You gave me special time even
when my heart had been broken</i>

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:55.774
<i>A red which was a bit tangled</i>

02:07:00.445 --> 02:07:08.453
<i>A white which was a color
of corridor at that days</i>

02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:20.298
<i>Beginning, last time, and now</i>

02:07:22.592 --> 02:07:30.600
<i>I'll convey you carving on
petals which are fluttering</i>

02:07:34.312 --> 02:07:35.814
<i>Darling</i>

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:43.822
<i>I and you reflected on raindrops</i>

02:07:45.866 --> 02:07:53.874
<i>No one in the world knows</i>

02:08:01.423 --> 02:08:07.053
<i>Ah... I fell in love...
I don ft remember since when</i>

02:08:07.053 --> 02:08:10.557
<i>How many times I cried</i>

02:08:10.557 --> 02:08:16.438
<i>If I count it, it will take whole night</i>

02:08:16.438 --> 02:08:21.193
<i>I'll be puzzled...</i>

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:25.530
<i>Darling</i>

02:08:34.247 --> 02:08:41.796
<i>What I want to convey to you now</i>

02:08:42.797 --> 02:08:47.177
<i>has been same and not changed</i>

02:08:47.177 --> 02:08:55.185
<i>since the past times.</i>

02:08:56.353 --> 02:08:57.771
<i>Darling</i>

02:08:57.771 --> 02:09:05.779
<i>The only one signpost</i>

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:16.039
<i>we can walk without losing way</i>
